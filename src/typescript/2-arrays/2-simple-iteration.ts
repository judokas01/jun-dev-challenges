 * There are 4 pretty similar ways how to iterate (go through) over an array in JavaScript.

 * 3. forEach
 * 4. map

 * Create all four ways how to do this. The task is just to console log each element.
 * Really just `console.log(element)`
 *
 * If you want to be sure, there is a test:
 * `npx jest src/typescript/2-arrays/2-simple-iteration.spec.ts`
